Sams, M., Manninen, P., Surakka, V., Helin, P., & Kättö, R. (1998). McGurk effect in Finnish syllables, isolated words, and words in sentences: Effects of word meaning and sentence context. Speech Communication, 26(1), 75-87. <br/>

**Subjects**: 65 undergraduate students (62 females, 19-45 years old), most were volunteers <br/>
**Stimuli**: One female talker in front of a white background with her head supported against the wall to avoid movements. She uttered each stimulus several times and the most neutral and clear tokens were selected for the experiment. Informants saw the talker-face on a computer screen as the distance of 60 cm. They were told that the stimuli might be meaningful and meaningless but not about McGurk effect. Subjects had 6 s to answer before the next stimuli started.  

**1.	/pa/ and /ka/**<br/>
  •	Combines and expected to give rise in most cases to /ta/ or /ka/ perceptions <br/>
  •	Acoustical /ka/ was dubbed on to the visual presentation of /ka/ (often perceived as /pka/ or /kpa/) <br/>
**2.	19 different solitary shot natural words, containing phonemes /p/ and /k/ in various vowel context** <br/>
  •	Words like /pannu/ were combined with visual perception of  /kannu/ -> expected /tannu/ (non-word) or /kannu/ (meaningful) <br/>
  •	Combinations: <br/>
    	Meaningful (audio) + meaningful (video) -> expected: non-word/video <br/>
    	Meaningless (audio) + meaningless (video) <br/>
**3.	42 different short natural Finnish words and non-words**, containing phonemes /p/ and /k/ in various vowel context, **presented in different location of three-words sentences.** (the length up to 6 s) **WHITE NOISE OF 53 dB!!!!!** <br/>
  •	Combinations: <br/>
    	Meaningful (audio) + meaningless (video) -> non-word/video <br/>
    	Meaningless (audio) + meaningless (video) <br/>
    	Discordant word could be the first, the middle and the last <br/>

**Results (first words and non-word of the sentence):** <br/>
acoustically meaningful sentences: <br/>
  •	17% audio <br/>
  •	26% video <br/>
  •	25% something else <br/>
  •	**13% fusion non-word** <br/>
  •	19% other non-word <br/>
 auditory and visual non-words: <br/>
  •	11% audio <br/>
  •	43% video <br/>
  •	15% something else <br/>
  •	**29% fusion non-word** <br/>
  •	2% other non-word <br/>
Differed statictically significantly  
  
**Results (last words and non-word of the sentence):** <br/>
acoustically meaningful sentences: <br/>
  •	8% audio <br/>
  •	33% video <br/>
  •	9% something else <br/>
  •	**35% fusion non-word** <br/>
  •	15% other non-word <br/>
 auditory and visual non-words: <br/>
  •	8% audio <br/> 
  •	27% video <br/>
  •	18% something else <br/>
  •	**45% fusion non-word** <br/>
  •	2% other non-word <br/>


**Omissions:** (простите, что конспект здесь непонятный, но я просто переписывала, что они дают в статье) <br/>
  •	occurred in /u/ (2/3) - initial consonants were not perceived in 50% <br/>
  •	words started acoustically with /pa/ (10/16) - 7% <br/>
  •	/p/ in /i/ context (2/3) - 2.3% <br/>
  •	occurred in /e/ with /p/ <br/>
  
 The McGurk effect is very robust - in the experiment it modifies the perception approximately in 90% of the subjects.
